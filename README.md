ofxVimba
========

Introduction
------------
ofxVimba wraps the Vimba API to allow easy communication between openFrameworks and Allied Vision cameras (GigE, USB3, etc.)  
This addon is brand new, and in active development.  `Watch` or check back soon for examples, tests, updates.

Installation
------------
Windows 7-10 / Visual Studio (2015+) only currently!  Might work with some library finagling on Linux.  OSX is unsupported by Vimba.  
Install the [Allied Vision Vimba SDK](https://www.alliedvision.com/en/products/software.html)  
Clone into `openFrameworks/addons/` folder.  Add ofxVimba.props file to your Visual Studio project.  
Definitely some bugs on the build events (DLL copies)!  Will be fixing this shortly.
